## About a Wordle

Wordle is a word-guessing game. The object of the game is to guess a 5-letter word in 6 tries.

### How to play Wordle?

Guess the word in 6 tries.

Each guess must be a valid 5 real letter word found on the dictionary. Hit the enter button to submit.

After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

### How to start a Wordle game?

Think of a word with 5 letters in it.

Type it and hit Enter. You can use your keyboard (desktop) or the letters on the screen(mobile).

The game will now paint the letters in your guess with different colors: green, yellow, and gray.

With this info, you have better information about what letters should or shouldn't be in the word.

Now think of another word with the hints you received. Type it down and hit Enter.

Repeat this process until you guess the right word.

If you haven't guessed the word in 6 tries, don't worry. Although in the original version this means the game ended for you, on our site you will be able to repeat this Wordle at the end of the game.

When you find the right word, don't forget to share it on Twitter/WhatsApp or via e-mail for others to enjoy it too.

### Tips for playing Wordle

Start with a word that contains as many vowels as possible and no repeating letters, such as "RADIO." More options are the words “CRANE" or “SLOTH,” which mathematicians have found to include many frequently used letters.

If you are stuck and can't think of a word with the hints provided with your guesses. Just type another word that comes to your head. But if you can choose a word that has different letters from your other guesses, you will get as many new hints as possible.
